With "Programming Fundamentals" students begin to study SoftUni's internal program for comprehensive training of software engineers. The course examines fundamental concepts in programming, which are the basis for effective and quality training in professional modules. Learners build on the knowledge gained in the Programming Basics course and begin to use more complex programming techniques and structures such as arrays, worksheets, objects and classes.


Additional technologies needed by each software developer, such as HTML and CSS, HTTP, bitwise operations and others, are studied. The basics of web development are considered, as well as one of the most common technologies and tools, with which the course successfully builds students' understanding of upcoming professional modules and the knowledge they will gain from them to become successful software developers.
