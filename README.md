SoftUni's Software University project was founded with the idea of an innovative and modern educational center that creates true professionals in the world of programming. For us, as for the entire software industry, the most important are real practical skills.

That is why we use the "learning by doing" model, providing our students with programming training with real practical experience and knowledge in the most popular and modern technologies, preparing to start your career as a successful software engineer.
